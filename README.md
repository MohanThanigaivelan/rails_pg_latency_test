# README

## Getting started

You'll need to have Docker installed. To start up the application in your local Docker environment:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:MohanThanigaivelan/rails_pg_latency_test.git
cd rails_pg_latency_test
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## Overview

This project uses [Toxiproxy](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy) to add latency toxics to postgres DB connection and [Benchmark](https://github.com/ruby/benchmark) for  measuring and reporting the time used to execute ruby code.


## Execution of queries in Sequential , load_async and Pipeline mode 

User model has a slow_query scope. 

```sh
scope :slow_query, ->(time) {
        where("SELECT true FROM pg_sleep(?)", time) } 
```

Each test case queries the user table five times with the above scope.

## Result

#### With Network Latency 50ms

| Query execution |     Time              |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| sequential      | 15.31580271600069     |
| Query Pipeline  | 15.087736591000066    |
| load_async      | 7.286523711998598     |



#### With Network Latency 2000ms

| Query execution |     Time              |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| sequential      | 25.075979429002473    |
| Query Pipeline  | 17.024850215999322    |
| load_async      | 25.072874052999396    |


## Run tests

Run test cases to view the results of query execution in sequential, load_async and pipeline mode 

```sh
docker exec -it web bash
rspec
```

## load_async setup

When the queries are executed with load_async option for the first time, Rails tries to establish new database connections and hence the queries take longer. An initial test case has been added to setup the pool of active connections, which could then be used by the subsequent test cases.
